# 🔧 Admin Edit Functionality Debug

## 🚨 Current Issue
Edit functionality returning 404 errors for URLs like:
- `/admin/posts/cmewyhw9s0002uk9kvp0njhmm`

## ✅ Correct URL Structure
The edit URLs should be:
- `/admin/posts/POST_ID/edit`

## 🔍 Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check Current Posts
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/posts`
2. Look at the available posts
3. Note the post IDs

### Step 2: Test Edit URLs Manually
Try these URLs directly in your browser:
1. `http://localhost:3000/admin/posts/POST_ID/edit`
2. Replace POST_ID with an actual post ID from the admin posts list

### Step 3: Check if Issue is with Links
1. In admin posts page, right-click on "Edit" button
2. Select "Copy link address"
3. Check if the URL includes `/edit` at the end

## 🔧 Quick Fix
If the edit links are missing `/edit`, the issue is in the admin posts page template.

## 🌐 Test URLs
Once you have a post ID, test these URLs:
- View post: `http://localhost:3000/posts/POST_SLUG`
- Edit post: `http://localhost:3000/admin/posts/POST_ID/edit`
- Admin dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/admin`

## ⚡ Expected Behavior
1. Click "Edit" on a post in admin posts list
2. Should redirect to `/admin/posts/POST_ID/edit`
3. Should load the edit form with existing post data
4. Should allow saving changes

## 🆘 If Still Not Working
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check server terminal for detailed error messages
3. Try editing a different post
4. Clear browser cache and cookies
